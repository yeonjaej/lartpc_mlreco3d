            Since one of the GNNs are turned on, process_fragments is turned ON.
            

        Fragment processing is turned ON. When training CNN models from
         scratch, we recommend turning fragment processing OFF as without
         reliable segmentation and/or cnn clustering outputs this could take
         prohibitively large training iterations.
